title: simple http serve a directory from terminal
---

Very often I need to look at some files in the browser.
For this I use "http-server":https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server. It is a lightweight and simple cli http server for node.

Just install it with npm:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install http-server -g
{% endhighlight %}

Then run it:
{% highlight bash %}
http-server . -c-1
{% endhighlight %}
The -c-1 arg busts the cache (cache =-1)

For convenience I have a small "fish":http://fishshell.com/ function for it:

{% highlight bash %}
function serve
  http-server $argv -c-1
end
{% endhighlight %}

So when I want to serve something I just do:

{% highlight bash %}
serve .
 Starting up http-server, serving . on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
 Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
{% endhighlight %}
