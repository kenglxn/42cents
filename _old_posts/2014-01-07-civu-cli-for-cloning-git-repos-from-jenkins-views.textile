title: civu, a CLI for cloning git repositories from jenkins views
---

The other day I was starting work on a project that had a large code base spread across many git repositories. 
There was no defined list of which repositories I needed to clone, as it depended on what people were working on. 
The team had just cloned the repositories as they saw the need. 
I prefer to clone the whole codebase, so I have everything locally. 
The project used jenkins, and on jenkins there was a structure based on views. 
Each view was a set of builds relating to a product suite, or codebase. 
This meant that all the repositories I needed where listed in a view on jenkins. 

h2. Ruby Hacking the civu CLI

The weekend came and I decided to do a bit of ruby hacking. 
I wanted a simple CLI that would let me point at a jenkins and tell it which view I wanted to clone repositories for. 

After a couple of days of hacking civu was born. "CIVU":https://github.com/kenglxn/civu is available through "rubygems":http://rubygems.org/gems/civu.  
Just install with gem and run it.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install civu
$ civu --help 
$ civu list viewname
$ civu clone viewname
{% endhighlight %}
