I'm a big fan of the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro technique</a>.
The pomodoro technique is basically working for a set amount of time, then taking small breaks before returning to work.

A couple of the reasons i like it are:
<ol>
	<li>it boosts focus</li>
	<li>reduces stress</li>
	<li>prevents me from sitting still for a long time without break</li>
	<li>forces me to do something else, like take a 5 minute walk (good for health)</li>
	<li>gives the brain time to work for you, actually enabling me to sometimes see that I'm on the wrong track early.</li>
	<li>Can easily be combined with agile methods</li>
</ol>
There are probably more things that I have forgotten right now, but my main point is that I think it is a good way to work.

I currently use <a title="ChromoDoro: a Pomodoro extension for chrome" href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/edhkjecdcakijjmlelnjjiohjmlaikhb">ChromoDoro</a>, a great plugin, except for one thing: It's a plugin. I don't want my break to be spent in front of the computer, but rather on a walk to the watering hole or similar, and taking the computer with me is not an option.

So how about a nice pomodoro plugin for android, there are some out there which can be downloaded, but i figure "Hey, what a great opportunity to get introduced to android application development " :)

I have added a repository on github at <a href="http://github.com/kenglxn/Pomodroid">http://github.com/kenglxn/Pomodroid</a>, and will be adding code to it as I find the time.

Here are my user stories so far:
<ul>
	<li>as a user I should be able to set pomodoro time, and break time, so that I can have the timer fit my workhabits.</li>
	<li>as a user I should be able to set the pomodoro timer to vibrate, so that I wont disturb my co-workers with my pomodoro weirdness.</li>
	<li>as a user I should be able to start the timer so that my worksessions can begin.</li>
	<li>as a user I should be able to stop the session before timer runs out, so that I can handle interruptions.</li>
	<li>as an application I should pause the pomodoro timer when the user recieves a phonecall, so that I can account for interruptions.</li>
	<li>as a user I should be asked to give a reason for the interruption, so that I can later review my flow efficiency</li>
	<li>as a user I should be able to access statistics of my interruptions, so that I can reflect on my flow efficiency, and perhaps find ways to improve it.</li>
</ul>
These user stories and more will be added to the <a href="http://github.com/kenglxn/Pomodroid/issues">issues</a> section of <a href="http://github.com/kenglxn/Pomodroid">Pomodroid project</a>.
