title: Using Sublime Text 2 as git commit message editor
---
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text Edit</a> is a very nice, lightweight, and highly custimizable editor for Mac.

Once you have it installed, set up a symlink so you can launch it from the command line.
<em>NOTE: do not use alias, as it behaves differently, and wont necessarily play nice with git.</em>

[code lang="bash"]
sudo ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/bin/subl
[/code]

This will enable you to launch subl with a directory argument, such as:

[code lang="bash"]
subl ~/projects/foo
## or
subl .
[/code]

Git can be configured to use this editor with the following command:
[code lang="bash"]
git config --global core.editor &quot;subl --wait&quot;
[/code]

Now Sublime will pop up when you do a git commit without a message. After writing the commit message, just save and quit sublime.
