title: PyramidSort, a Sublime Text plugin for for reformatting text 
---

I like my code to be neat.
When I look at a bit of code, it is not just the naming and syntax, but cleanliness I am looking at.
In fact I find neatly structured code to be much more legible than code which is just all over the place.
In addition to proper naming, good design and clarity, I think there is a visual aspect as well.
In many cases I have found that ordering certain types of statements by length has a positive effect on the overall cleanliness of that code file.

Enter PyramidSort
-----------------

Because of this, I found the need for a sorting plugin for my favorite text editor [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com).
The [PyramidSort](https://github.com/kenglxn/PyramidSortSublimeTextPlugin) plugin sorts the selected text by length ascending while removing blank lines.
The plugin is easy to install and use. Just follow the [instructions on the github page](https://github.com/kenglxn/PyramidSortSublimeTextPlugin#installing)
