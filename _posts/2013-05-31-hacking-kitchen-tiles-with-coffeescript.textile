title: hacking kitchen tiles with coffeescript
---

It was finally time to spruce up ye' ole' kichen. I had bought the tiles in shades of brown and white. The area to tile was about 50cm tall and 250cm wide. The tiles were 10cm x 10cm with 3mm spacers for the grout. Now all that remained was to find a pattern. I tried with pen and grid paper, but could not seem to find a pattern I liked. Then the idea struck me that this would be a great opportunity to hack a bit. I decided I wanted to encode something as binary ascii in the tiles, while making a tile pattern I found appealing. I ended up using this awesome "Boilerplate project using CS, AMD, Mocha and Testem":http://smuco.de/2013/04/25/coffeescript-amd-mocha-testem.html by "@smucode":https://twitter.com/smucode to create a small app that takes some input and converts it to binary ascii before rendering some tiles with a bit of border.

Please keep in mind that the whole thing was thrown together in an evening, so don't expect the world. The "code is on github":https://github.com/kenglxn/bin-ascii-tiles, and "running live here":http://kenglxn.github.io/bin-ascii-tiles/

h2. The result

I was rather pleased with the end result, but better than that is that my wife ended up loving it. When I told her that I had encoded a message in the tiles, she said "you're such a nerd" with a smile :)

h2. The Code

The whole app is just 33 lines of coffee, and looks like this:

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/kenglxn/bin-ascii-tiles/blob/master/src/coffee/app.coffee"></script>

Driven forth by a test suite about equal in size:
