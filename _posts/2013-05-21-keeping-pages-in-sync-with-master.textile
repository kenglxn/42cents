title: Keeping gh-pages branch in sync with master
---

For github project pages that are simply websites hosted on github pages like "this one":https://github.com/kenglxn/42cents I have found it a bit annoying to constantly merge master with gh-pages branch. I simply stay on the gh-pages branch ignoring master, but I really prefer to work on master. Guess It's a small OCD tendency I have..

h2. git shove

There are a number of ways to solve this. Like a git commit hook that merges, followed by a push --all. But I prefer setting an alias for it:

{% highlight bash %}
[alias]
    shove = !git push origin master && git push origin master:gh-pages
{% endhighlight %}

Now all I have to to to push both master and gh-pages while keeping them in sync is just to do a normal commit followed by git shove:
{% highlight bash %}
   (master) $ git ci -m "updated post"
[master b6806c3] updated post
 1 file changed, 18 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
   (master) $ git shove
